4hrs - Work on data structures for OCTranspo API
3hrs - Work on loading GTFS from net/loading from disk
    4hrs - work on optimizing this to load faster (ongoing)
3hrs - Making all calls to loading functions asynchronous, so as to not block the main thread

1hr  - debugging the differing results returned by OCAPI (they're not consistent in the slightest)
